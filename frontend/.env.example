# API Configuration
# --------------------------------------------
# The base URL for the backend API
# This is used by the frontend to make API calls to the backend
# IMPORTANT: This variable MUST be prefixed with NUXT_PUBLIC_ to be available in the browser
#
# Development: http://localhost:3001/api (backend runs on port 3001)
# Production: https://your-backend.onrender.com/api (your deployed backend URL)
#
# Note:
# - Include the /api path at the end
# - Do NOT include a trailing slash after /api
# - This variable is baked into the build at build time, so you need to rebuild after changing it
NUXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE=http://localhost:3001/api
